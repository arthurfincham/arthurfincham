#### :zap: Self Starter

A few weeks after graduation from university I started teaching myself the basics of programming. After following the Ruby track on Codecademy and some introductions to HTML and CSS, I set out to build my first project: [ClassNotes](https://github.com/arthurfincham/classnotes).

After a few iterations, I had finished an MVP over the summer before starting my bootcamp; an MVP built on RoR with a PostgreSQL database. With hindsight, some of the code was terrible! But I'm still proud of what I got done on my own initiative.

#### :ear: Communication

Being the first in my family to delve into a technical field, I have had to learn to communicate my dev-related ideas the hard way! I am also quite a social person; something that helped throughout my bootcamp experience while pair programming and collaborating on projects.

For half of my bootcamp as well as half of my university degree I was working from home due to Covid. As frustrating as this was, it helped me keep up good communitication when not face-to-face, using tools such as Slack and Zoom.

## Experience

#### :martial_arts_uniform: Roger Gracie Academy (Sep 19 to Aug 21)

_Front Desk_  
www.rogergracie.com  
During my final years at uni I worked part time (approx. 16hrs/week) at RGA, a world renowned Jiu Jitsu school in London. Responsiblities included selling memberships, helping prepare for each class and re-building the business' website with Squarespace. Worked hard throughout the pandemic to ensure the safety of our students.

## Education

#### :computer: Makers Academy (Aug 21 to Dec 21)

After teaching myself some basics of programming, I applied to Makers: a 16 week highly selective development bootcamp.

We began with **TDD** in **Ruby** and **Rspec** before moving to **OOD**, databases and web development. By the end of the course, I was confident and competent in building a full-stack application.

While I could have taught myself some of the programming skills, I felt that the experience of **Pair** **Programming** and collaborating with other was invaluable.

Our cohort was hybrid, meaning that our second of three projects was done remotely. Using **Agile** methodologies through tools like Trello and **GitHub**, we made good progress and got a taste of working in the real world.

#### :mortar_board: King's College London (Sept 18 to July 21)

_BA Philosophy, First Class Honours_

- Thesis on _The Consequences of Determinism for Moral Responsibility_.
- Modules in Elementary Logic & Philosophical Logic
- Half of my degree was spent at home due to Covid, which threw me into the deep end of working remotely!

## Hobbies

- Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
- My dog, Frank
